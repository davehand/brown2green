###README

The objective for our module is to extend the SOAP database by adding an additional table which would include information about municipalities and their building codes and zoning regulations. We would also like to be able to add tags to the locations with common building code properties to make the querying process more convenient and efficient.

For our end product, we would like the ability to enter in a location and return the building rules and zoning regulations for the area that it is contained in. A reach goal would be the ability to place the different municipalities onto the map on the SOAP page so that when a location is added, the user can easily visualize what municipality it belongs to.
