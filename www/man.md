##Manual for Team1 Soap Extension

Input page consists only of a search bar and two drop-down menus.

The left drop-down allows you to select a table to choose from.

The right drop-down allows you to select an attribute in that table to search by.
__WARNING__ There is no AJAX filtering out the parameters when you select a table, so all attributes are shown at once. Search on an attribute that does not belong to the selected table will yeild no results.

Finally, the search box allows text to be entered to search on. Clicking the submit button will show a table of results.
